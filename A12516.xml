            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the Book of the Pſalmes, it is an Epitome of the whole Scriptures, teaching vs what we are to beleeue and doe, both to God and man; In which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:28214:18"/>as in a glaſſe we may clearely behold the nature of GOD, his wiſedome, goodneſſe, and mercy towardes his Church and Children: As alſo moſt notable ſpectacles of his fearefull wrath &amp; vengeance againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly.</p>
               <p>If men would pray vnto God, and craue for any mercy and bleſſing at his hands, heere bee excellent plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes of true, hearty, and earneſt prayers. If men would giue thankes for bleſſings receiued, for iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts eſcaped, or for Deliuerance from wicked and vngodly men, here be worthy examples and directions: If men would finde comfort in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, troubles, and afflictions, and learne with patience to beare them; There is no part of the Bible more ſweete and comfortable: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould be our delight and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and wee ought to ſpend the more time in reading, and in the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo excellent and worthy a Booke; according to that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi>

               <p>I thought good to ſpeake of this Pſalme, becauſe it containeth in it a moſt worthy example of true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance, without which there is not, nor can be any pardon of ſinne; <hi>Except yee repent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 13.5. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pſalm.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Now it containeth a famous and moſt worthy example of repentance if you either regard the Perſon, who was a renowned and glorious King of Iſrael, a holy Prophet of God, yea a man after Gods owne heart.</p>
               <p>Againe, in the matter of the pſalme and of his repentance, you ſhall ſee a ſpectacle of many moſt great and grieuous ſins committed by <hi>Dauid:</hi> wherein we may ſee the great fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and weakenes of Gods children: which may teach vs to pray vnto the Lord, for the ſpirit of corroborati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:28214:19"/>on, for if <hi>Dauid</hi> fell, whither ſhall we fall, if God do but a litle leaue vs to our ſelues: And howſoeuer by the ſpeciall mercy of God towardes <hi>Dauid,</hi> this ſin of his preuailed not to his eternall condemnation; yet wee ſee what terrour of conſcience and griefe of heart he ſuſtained, before hee could bee aſſured of his former comfort. And this ſhal all fleſh find, that the pleaſures of ſinne, for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon heere, will bring with them ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the end.</p>
               <p>As for the repentance of <hi>Dauid,</hi> we ſhall ſee it is moſt excellent and admirable, for hee doth freely and frankly confeſſe his ſinnes, and is not aſhamed to Chronicle them euen in the word of God, for all poſterities to beg the pardon of them. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall ſee the endleſſe loue and mercy of GOD towards poore and miſerable ſinners, when they ſhall truly repent, and ſeeke for mercy.</p>
               <p>The whole Pſalme containes two parts:<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the Pſalme.</note> firſt, the preface of the pſalme, ſhewing the occaſion of it, and by

               <p>But ſome may ſay, I could neuer receiue any ſuch ſpirituall ioy in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Pſalmes.

               <p>Secondly, for the matter of our ſinging, it muſt be Pſalms &amp; Hymns, and ſpirituall Songs, not vile and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſongs, which are the diuels mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, in the mouths of prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: wherefore, let vs put away all vile and filthy Songs.

               <p>Thirdly, we muſt not ſing to ſpend the time, or to ſatisfie our eares with noiſe or tune, but in ſinging we muſt ſeeke to expreſſe our thank efulneſſe to God, to redeeme the time, be not like the tinckling Cimballs, nor the muſicke of children.

                  <p>The other queſtion is, ſeeing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> praies the Lord not <hi>to take his holy Spirit from him,</hi> whether the ſanctified gifts and graces of Gods holy Spirit may finally and totally bee loſt and taken away?

                  <p>Now becauſe theſe two queſtions be points of great moment, and on which all our happineſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth hang and depend: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſtand a little to proue them by teſtimonies of Scripture, with reaſons and arguments drawne from the written word of GOD, and remoue ſome obiections of the Papiſts againſt the certainety of our perſeuerance in faith to the end.</p>

                  <p> But admit, as the Papiſts would haue it, that a man might fall away fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then hee muſt bee cleane cut off from Chriſt: for hee muſt be cleane cut off from Chriſt and haue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction with him before hee fall away finally; then at his ſecond reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting he muſt bee Baptiſed, for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is the Sacrament of Incyſion or ingrafting into Chriſt: But that is abſurd that Baptiſme ſhould be any more then once adminſtred, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fore a man is but once vnited or once ingrafted, and cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnited and neuer fall: And therefore friuolous is that diſtinction of veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and mortall ſinnes with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, for if any ſinne of the Elect ſhould bee mortall: Then there muſt needs bee a ſecond renuing in the Elect vnto Chriſt, which is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to thinke,<note place="margin">Men muſt puta diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that they feele and that they haue.</note> for the Lord worketh this but once: And <hi>Dauid</hi> though at this time hee lay languiſhing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heate of the Lords wrath for thoſe horrible ſinnes of his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and murther, yet in this verſe

For his will,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> his will, <hi>God ſo loued them, that he ſent his Sonne to dye for them.</hi> Now this is a great triall, and proofe of his loue &amp; willingneſſe, that hee had rather ſee his only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſon, that was neere and deere vnto him, to bee hanged on the tree, to dye the curſed death on the croſſe, to ſhed his pretious bloud, and to beare the curſe of God, and helliſh torments, then to ſee any one of his elect to periſh.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.39.40.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for his power, that he is able to ſaue all thoſe whom hee will ſaue,<note place="margin">Eſay. 63.1.</note> it is manifeſt, God is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp; moſt righteous, &amp; mighty to ſaue, &amp; the Lord doth what hee will. <hi>None can take them out of my Fathers hands which is greater then all.</hi>

                     <hi>as thou art one in mee.</hi> Now then if Chriſts prayer bee of force, and can preuaile, and doe any thing with the Father, as hee confeſſeth, that the Father hath, doth, and will heare him in all things, then certainely no true beleeuer can periſh, and finally fall away.</p>
